# Triangle wave signal processing
This script handles generating a triangle wave signal, adding noise and filtering with a moving average window that minimize MSE. Also, it visualizes the signal, noise effects and filter performance.

# RLS
Implementation of the Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm for real-time parameter estimation of static and dynamic models. Optimizes the forgetting factor to minimize MSE.

# Adaptive Control
Adaptive control adjusts the system's input to match a desired reference signal in real-time, using RLS to estimate and update system parameters dynamically.
